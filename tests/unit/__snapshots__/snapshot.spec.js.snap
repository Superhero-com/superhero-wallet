             – they are self-enforcing agreements which are embedded in the source code. Therefore, the

             are a specific feature of the decentralized public ledger. If the websites/platforms/organizations/people who are tipped, do not have a

            </strong>
            the sent tip is stored in the so called “

             they can claim the

            initially tipped and stored in the “

            </strong>
             in a time frame of 1 (one) year from the moment of tipping. After the lapse of this 1 (one) year, the receiver loses their right to gain the

             loses its right to regain back the

              Æ tokens
            </strong>
             he has sent. Due to the decentralized character of the blockchain,

            </strong>
             cannot control the accumulation/receipt of the tips and to return them back when they are not received. Only the

             without limitation of time and without any purpose. This is why, after the lapse of the two years in which the receiver and the sender of the tips could claim the
